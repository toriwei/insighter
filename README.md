# insighter

Insighter gives users data about their top artists and tracks on Spotify. This web-app was made with the Spotify API, React, and Material UI.

## the process

I made this project during the summer of 2021. This was my first time working with this API, as well as React.js and Material UI.

## further developments

This code is not the best- it could use some cleaning up. Some of the styling could be cleaned up as well.

## running the app

To run the React app:

1. `cd client`
2. `npm start`

To run the Spotify login authentication (in a split terminal):

1. `cd auth-server`
2. `node /app.js`
